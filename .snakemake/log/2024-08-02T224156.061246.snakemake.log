MissingOutputException in rule get_inventory in file C:\Users\js199\OneDrive\Desktop\Drought-Index\Snakefile, line 31:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/ghcnd-inventory.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: dataREADME.md, ghcnd-stations.txt, ghcnd_all.tar.gz, ghcnd_all_files.txt, index.html)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
