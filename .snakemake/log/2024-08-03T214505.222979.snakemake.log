MissingOutputException in rule summarize_dly_files in file /mnt/c/Users/js199/OneDrive/Desktop/Drought-Index/Snakefile, line 56:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/ghcnd_tidy.tsv.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: dataREADME.md, ghcnd-inventory.txt, ghcnd-stations.txt, ghcnd_all.tar.gz, ghcnd_all_files.txt, ghcnd_cat.gz, index.html, temp)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
